Reproducible Science
====================

A boilerplate for reproducible and transparent science with close resemblances to the philosophy of [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science): *A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work.*

Requirements
------------
Install `cookiecutter` command line: `pip install cookiecutter`    

Usage
-----
To start a new science project:

`cookiecutter gh:mkrapp/cookiecutter-reproducible-science`

Project Structure

Check out my latest research project, which successfully applied the `cookiecutter` philosophy: [SEMIC: an efficient surface energy and mass balance model applied to the Greenland ice sheet](https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/krapp/semic-project).
